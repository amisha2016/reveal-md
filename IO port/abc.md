#Background

The Indian startup ecosystem has seen a lot of activity in terms of growth
of number of startups that emerged and also in terms of deals for funding
that got closed and amount that were funded.

 According to the Indian startup ecosystem, in the first quarter of 2015,
Indian startups raised $1.7 billion from investors.


India has truly become a start-up ‘Nation’.

This country, a home to a new breed of young startups, has clearly evolved to become the third largest base of technology start-ups in the world.

In the year 2015 in Q1, startups in India had raised close to $450 million,
a 300% growth in the amount raised. There were 300 deals in the entire
year in 2014 – half of that many deals were made in Q1-2015. In the similar time frame,
 the UK startup scene saw $ 682 million
investment and the U.S. startups have raised about $9.7 billion in Q1
2015.

All this data shows a robust ecosystem of Startup culture that is coming
up with technology driven payments and consumer web sectors having
cornered more than half of the entire funding amount; mobile,
eCommerce and SaaS (Software and Services) companies and others
accounted for the other half.


Against this bright background, however, the challenge that the young
student innovators face is to raise the initial funding for his startup.

Business Plan, Product development and validation is his major challenge at this stage.

Startup launch, product development and validation requires some
investment part of the young innovator. The initial funds needed at this
time usually comes friends, family, Angel investors etc.


However, when technology is untested and market is unsure making
returns uncertain, the risk of investment is too high for conventional
investors.
The funds required at this pre-incubation stage is not a very large fund by
volume but it does certainly gives the startup and the young innovator a
breather in this competitive space.


##National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI)
is a
programme  conceived  and  developed  by  the    Innovation  &  Entrepreneurship  division, 
Department  of  Science  &  Technology,  Government  of  India,  for  nurturing  ideas  and
